# Project Name
Student Data Management System with Data Structures (BST, AVL, Min Heap, Max Heap)
# Description
This project implements a student data management system using various data structures: Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL tree, Min Heap, and Max Heap. Each student record includes an ID, name, GPA, and department. The system allows users to add, remove, search for students, and print student information sorted by different criteria.
# Problem Definition
The application supports the following functionalities:
1. Add a student: Allows users to add a student with a unique ID (ranging from 0 to 100), name, GPA, and department.
2. Remove a student: Removes a student from the data structure using their ID.
3. Search for a student: Finds and displays information about a student using their ID.
4. Print all and Department Report:
   - Print All: Displays all student information sorted by ID.
   - Department Report: Provides a count of students per department.
The application supports four main data structures for storing student data:
- BST: Stores students in a Binary Search Tree based on their ID.
- AVL: Stores students in an AVL Tree (self-balancing BST) based on their ID.
- Min Heap: Stores students in a Min Heap based on their GPA.
- Max Heap: Stores students in a Max Heap based on their GPA.
# Usage
To use this program:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
3. Prepare an input file with student data as described.
4. Run the main program to interactively manage student data using the specified data structures and functionalities.
